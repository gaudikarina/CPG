# Comparison of CPG topologies for bipedal gait

A Central Pattern Generator (CPG) is a network of neurons capable of producing oscillatory signals without oscillatory inputs. 
This paper proposes of gait generator for lower lumbar exoskeleton, based on neurophysiological principles. In this manner, based in an Amplitude Controlled Phase Oscillator 
(ACPO) implementation for a CPG, acting as trajectory generator
in normal gait for hip and knee joints of a lower lumbar
exoskeleton. Three types of topologies are evaluated to determine
the most suitable for this system. The results indicated that
the ”A” topology exhibits a smoother reaction to perturbations,
which is desirable for a safe and comfortable human-machine
interaction. It is also proposed as future work, the evaluation of
the trajectories generator in the exoskeleton model and control.
